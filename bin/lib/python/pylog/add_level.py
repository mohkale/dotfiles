Add a level to logging in a way where it appears such as it was builtin.

    """
    Comprehensively add a new logging level to the `logging` module and the currently configured logging class.

    Taken from [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/35804945][here]].

    `level_name` becomes an attribute of the `logging` module with the value
    `level_num`. `method_name` becomes a convenience method for both `logging`
    itself and the class returned by `logging.getLoggerClass()` (usually just
    `logging.Logger`). If `method_name` is not specified, `level_name.lower()` is
    used.

    To avoid accidental clobberings of existing attributes, this method will
    raise an `AttributeError` if the level name is already an attribute of the
    `logging` module or if the method name is already present.

    Example
    -------
    >>> addLoggingLevel('TRACE', logging.DEBUG - 5)
    >>> logging.getLogger(__name__).setLevel("TRACE")
    >>> logging.getLogger(__name__).trace('that worked')
    >>> logging.trace('so did this')
    >>> logging.TRACE
    5

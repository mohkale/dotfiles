* Dotfiles
  My dotfile repository, happily brought to you by [[https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot][dotbot]] :book:.

** Requirements
   - python >= 3.7

** Installation Instructions
   =git clone /uri/of/this/repo ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles && ./install= will install
   a basic dotfile configuration for you.

   However you'll more likely want to setup a bunch of different things, and to that end
   you can do so by passing the ~DOTBOTS~ environment variable to install. ~DOTBOTS~
   should be a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values][CSV]] list of features you want installed, for a list of available features
   you can run:

   #+NAME: config-options
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :results value list :exports code
   ./setup/list-opts
   #+END_SRC

   WARN: to run the above command, you must have loaded any required submodules.
         you can do so non-destructively by running ~./install --help~.

   I recommend using the dotbots specified by ~./setup/suggested -awe --nvim~. I.E.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :results value :exports code
   DOTBOTS=$(./setup/suggested -awe --nvim | tr '\n' ',') ./install
   #+END_SRC

** Supported Platforms
   * [[https://gitforwindows.org/][git-bash-for-windows]]@2.25.1
   * [[http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS][msys]]@2019.05.24

** Directory Layout
   | path     | purpose                                                    |
   |----------+------------------------------------------------------------|
   | core     | core files which're installed regardless of environment.   |
   | desktop  | configs for desktop environments, window managers, etc.    |
   | editors  | vim, emacs... what more do you need.                       |
   | langs    | setup multiple programming languages & environments.       |
   | programs | sets up various programs, eg. zathura or konsole.          |
   | dist     | configurations for specific distros or environments.       |
   | bin      | scripts, executables, commands. you get the idea :sunglasses:.       |
   | shells   | bash, zsh, etc. each have their own setup requirements.    |
   | setup    | dotbot, plugins for dotbot, dotfile introspection scripts. |

** Notes
   - On windows, you must run install from an elevated shell. This is because windows
     doesn't allow users with regular privilages to create symbolic links.
   - On windows, [[https://chocolatey.org/][chocolatey]] doesn't seem to like installation when stderr is the null
     device. The only workaround as of now is to run ~./install~ with the ~-v~ flag
     (or to configure chocolatey to always output).
   - for those using windows, make sure to order the msys package manager before pacman.
     msys uses the pacman package manager... and so does arch; meaning if your pacman
     packages come before your msys ones, the pacman packages will be installed even when
     you're on windows.
